# SeedMigration

Seed Migrations are a way to manage changes to seed data in a rails app in a similar way to how schema migrations are handled.

## Intro

A data migration library, similar to rails built-in schema migration. It also auto generates a `db/seeds.rb` file, similar to how schema migrations generate the `db/schema.rb` file.
Using this auto generated seed file makes it quick and easy to setup new environments, usually development or test.

## Installation

Add `gem 'seed_migration'` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'seed_migration'
```

## Usage

### Install and run the internal migrations

```
rake seed_migration:install:migrations
rake db:migrate
```

That will create the table to keep track of data migrations.

### Generate a new migration

You can use the generator :

```
rails g seed_migration AddFoo
```
A new file will be created under `db/data/` using rails migration convention:

```
db/data/20140407162007_add_foo.rb
```

You'll need to implement the `#up` method and if you need to be able to rollback, the `#down` method.

### Running the migrations

To run all pending migrations, simply use

```
rake seed:migrate
```

If needed, you can run a specific migration:

```
rake seed:migrate MIGRATION=20140407162007_add_foo.rb
```

### Rollback

Rolling back the last migration is as simple as:

```
rake seed:rollback
```

You can rollback more than one migration at the same time:

```
rake seed:rollback STEP=3 # rollback last 3 migrations
```

Or rollback a specific migration:

```
rake seed:rollback MIGRATION=20140407162007_add_foo.rb
```

### Status

See the status of your migrations:

```
rake seed:migrate:status
```

Example output:

```
database: seed-migrationdevelopment

 Status   Migration ID    Migration Name
--------------------------------------------------
   up     20160114153832  Add users
  down    20160114153843  Add more users
  down    20160114153851  Add even more users
```

### Registering models

By default no models are registered, so running seed migrations won't update the seeds file.
You have to manually register the models in the configuration file.

Simply register a model:

```ruby
SeedMigration.register Product
```

You can customize the 'seeded' attribute list:

```ruby
SeedMigration.register User do
  exclude :id, :password
end
```

This will create a `seeds.rb` containing all User and Product in the database:

```ruby
# encoding: UTF-8
# This file is auto-generated from the current content of the database. Instead
# of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of Seed Migration to
# incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this seed file.
#
# If you need to create the database on another system, you should be using
# db:seed, not running all the migrations from scratch. The latter is a flawed
# and unsustainable approach (the more migrations you'll amass, the slower
# it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
#
# It's strongly recommended to check this file into your version control system.

ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  Product.create("created_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z", "id"=>1, "name"=>"foo", "updated_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z")
  Product.create("created_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z", "id"=>2, "name"=>"bar", "updated_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z")
  # ...
  User.create("created_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z", "id"=>1, "name"=>"admin", "updated_at"=>"2014-04-04T15:42:24Z")
  # ...
end

SeedMigration::Migrator.bootstrap(20140404193326)
```

Note that `seeds.rb` is only generated in development mode.  Production data will not be dumped in this process.

### Checking for pending migrations

Check for pending data migrations:

```ruby
SeedMigration::Migrator.check_pending!
```

If there are pending migrations, this will raise
`SeedMigration::Migrator::PendingMigrationError`.

### Adding seed_migrations to an existing app

If your app already contains seeds, using this gem could cause some issues.
Here is the basic process to follow to ensure a smooth transition:

- Clean your local database, and seed it, that can be done with `rake db:reset`
- register all the models that were created in the original seeds file
- run `rake seed:migrate`
- At this point, your seeds file will be rewritten with all the `create` statements
- Commit/Push the updated seeds file

### Deployment notes

It is recommended to add the `rake seed:migrate` to your deploy script, so each new data migrations is ran upon new deploys.
You can enable the `extend_native_migration_task` option to automatically run `rake seed:migrate` after `rake db:migrate`.

For Capistrano 3.x support, add this to your Capfile

```ruby
require 'capistrano/seed_migration_tasks'
```

which provides the two cap tasks, which you can add to your deploy script or run on the command line:

```ruby
cap {stage} seed:migrate
cap {stage} seed:rollback
```

## Example

```ruby
rails g seed_migration AddADummyProduct
```

```ruby
class AddADummyProduct < SeedMigration::Migration
    def up
        Product.create!({
            :asset_path => "valentines-day.jpg",
            :title => "Valentine's Day II: the revenge!",
            :active => false,
            :default => false,
        }, :without_protection => true)
    end

    def down
        Product.destroy_all(:title => "Valentine's Day II: the revenge!")
    end
end
```

## Configuration

Use an initializer file for configuration.

### List of available configurations :

- `extend_native_migration_task (default=false)`
- `ignore_ids (default=false)`
- `migration_table_name (default='seed_migration_data_migrations')`: Override the table name for the internal model that holds the migrations
- `use_strict_create (default=false)`: Use `create!` instead of `create` in `db/seeds.rb` when set to true

#### example:

```ruby
# config/initializers/seed_migration.rb

SeedMigration.config do |c|
    c.migration_table_name = 'data_migrations'
    c.extend_native_migration_task = true
    c.register User do
      exclude :id, :password
    end
    c.register Product
end
```

## Compatibility

At the moment, we rely by default on

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.reset_pk_sequence!
```
which is `pg` only.

If you need to use this gem with another database, use the `ignore_ids` configuration.


## Runnings tests


```
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake app:db:reset
bundle exec rspec spec
```
